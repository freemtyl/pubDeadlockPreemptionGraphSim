Written in Python and using libraries: NetworkX, matPlotLib, and time. Simulates an operating system.
Reads from multiple files to determine the amount of resources and processes needed. Reads each line and processes requesting or freeing calls to resources.
Creates a graph using NetworkX and after each line updates and draws. As well as maintaining the graph, detects cycles and deadlock.
